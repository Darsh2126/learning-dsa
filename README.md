# learning-dsa

##### This repo is for learning different DSA concepts and parts will we upload everything list by list (whatever we will learn)(Right now we are using Typescript for this learning and afterwards will add some other languages)


#### Array => Traversal (Looping)

1. It is basically for loop so in simple terms we are iterating through the whole array and able to find our desired query
2. for loop is basically of 0(n) complexity

#### Array => Two pointers
The Two Pointers technique involves using two indices (pointers) to iterate over an array (or two arrays) in a single pass to solve problems efficiently.

It's great for problems like:

- Searching pairs

- Reversing arrays

- Merging sorted arrays

- Detecting duplicates 

- Palindromes

- Moving zeros / partitioning arrays
